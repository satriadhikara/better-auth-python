# better-auth-python

**Python port** of [Better Auth](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth) - a framework-agnostic authentication (and authorization) library.

This Python implementation allows you to use the familiar Better Auth client APIs and patterns, but with Python backend services like FastAPI or Flask.
